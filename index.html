    <h2><u>What is FIRST?</u></h2>
    <p>FIRST Robotics (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international youth organization that hosts robotics competitions designed to inspire young people to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
There are several programs under the FIRST umbrella, each tailored to different age groups:
FIRST LEGO League (FLL) – For students aged 4–16 (varies by country). Teams build and program robots using LEGO kits and solve real-world problems.
FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) – For middle and high school students. Teams build smaller robots using a reusable kit and compete in head-to-head challenges.
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) – For high school students. Teams design, build, and program industrial-sized robots to compete in a themed game, with strict rules, time limits, and limited resources.
FIRST emphasizes teamwork, creativity, and "Gracious Professionalism®," encouraging collaboration and respect even in competitive environments.</p>

<h2><u>Who are the Circuit Sorcerers?</u></h2>
  <p class="WhoAreWe column">
    We are an enthusiastic community of students and alumni coming together to create a
    new FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team, eager to explore the realm of STEM in the
    form of hands-on learning. Our mission is to provide all members with the chance to foster
    hands-on, real-world engineering, programming, design, and teamwork skills, preparing us
    not only for competition, but for our futures. What sets us apart is our creative drive: we
    aim to inject a powerful visual presence into all we do, from our robot to our presence at
    competitions. Now, because we are a rookie team starting in the 2026 robotics season, we don't have a lot of experience to show that we have achieved those goals mention previously. However that doesn't mean that we aren't going to try and give it our all!

           <h2><u>Mission statement  </u></h2>
           <p>We are an enthusiastic community of students and alumni coming together to create a new FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team, eager to explore the realm of STEM in the form of hands-on learning. Our mission is to provide all members with the chance to foster hands-on, real-world engineering, programming, design, and teamwork skills, preparing us not only for competition, but for our futures. What sets us apart is our creative drive: we aim to inject a powerful visual presence into all we do, from our robot to our presence at competitions.</p>
           <h2><u>History  </u></h2>
           <p> Because we are a rookie team, we don't have much of a team history to share with you. However that does not mean we are inexperienced! Our mentors/coaches are FIRST Alumni as well as college students. They have years of FRC experience under their belt and will be doing nothing else if not sharing those experiences with the team. A couple of us also have a background in FTC teams as well as FLL teams!</p>
           <h2> Our Impact</h2>
           <p>We believe that being a FIRST robotics student is more than just making super cool robots to compete against other schools. We understand that STEM can be taught to young innovators as early as elementary and that's why we are partnering with a local Rotaract chapter to teach STEAM classes to students at our local library. Also because we are not affiliated with any independent school districts, we are able to include a diverse group of students into our program without any limitations or restrictions, hence furthering our community impact by reaching out to young adults who would otherwise never have this great opportunity.  </div>
